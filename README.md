## Contributing
This project was originally intended to be a simple tool for me to use. However, I thought it would be best to share my tool with anyone who wants to use it and I would love to see it continue to grow. If you would like to contribute whether that be in the form of  code, money, words of inspiration, or criticisms, I would wholeheartedly appreciate it. Please feel free to reach out to me. My contact information is provided on my profile.
